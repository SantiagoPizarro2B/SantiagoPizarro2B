# Introduction
Hello, I'm Santiago, a student currently pursuing a Higher National Diploma (HND) in Video Game Development along with a Higher National Diploma in 3D Animations, Games, and Interactive Environments (CFGS).

# Academic Background
In my studies, I've engaged in diverse projects covering concept art, 3D modeling, texturing, rigging, animation, skinning, and programming. Among these, my primary interests lie in 3D modeling and texturing.

# Software Proficiency
I've worked extensively with industry-standard software such as Maya and Substance Painter, and I have some experience with Unreal Engine.

Here are some images of the programs I've used:

# Portfolio
You can find my portfolio on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/santiagopizarro7). I'm currently enhancing it, and the showcased projects are from class assignments. In the future, I plan to upload personal projects to which I dedicate more care.
